# Project in Process !
Excuse the missing doc.

# Positions
Positions are specific points in n Dimensions $$n\in(1,2,3)$$

`get_distance()`
$$d(\mathbf{p,q})=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(p_i-q_i)^2}$$
# Shapes

# objects are positions and shapes...

does everything needs to be a class in Line_points or would be int/float okay?

current work:
`__truediv__()`
to calculate the center points....

- [x] truediv seems to work in Point1D
- [ ] tests for list

- test
- positions
- [x] get_distance
- [x] get_center
- shapes
- [x] ``get_line_points( )``

- over powered using the get_distance from Point1D in Line2D or simple math?!
