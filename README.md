# objects are positions and shapes...

does everything needs to be a class in Line_points or would be int/float okay?

current work:
`__truediv__()`
to calculate the center points....

- [x] truediv seems to work in Point1D
- [ ] tests for list

- test
- positions
- [x] get_distance
- [x] get_center
- shapes
- ``[ ] get_line_points( )``

- over powered using the get_distance from Point1D in Line2D or simple math?!
